# Quizzie

Powered by React, Redux Toolkit, and Google Firebase
This is a quiz app where the user can sign up, enter their own series of questions and answers, then use the app to help them study.
Once the user has entered all of the questions and answers, that data set is sent to the server, Google Firebase. When the user selects a quiz to take, the functional logic will pool all of the answers together, shuffle the answers, then assign up to three incorrect answers along with the correct answer in an answer pool. If the selected answer matches the correct answer, one point is added to the score. The user can then view the results.
